  <h2>Introduction</h2>
   <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>

Image Inpainting is the art of restoring destroied parts of
an image by using information of valid parts of the image
in a way, so that the human eye does not recognize the
damaged areas (at least not at a first sight).
In video processing image inpainting is often applied to
videos in order to remove TV station logos.

This plugin comes with the intention
to provide a suit for the removal of logos,
whether opaque or transparent. It provides algorithms for
these tasks:
<ul>
<li><b>Logo detection</b>: An obstacle is analyzed
closely after being masked roughly by the user. The exact
color map of the logo is determined as well as its alpha
mask.</li>
<li><b>Deblending</b>: Given the color image and alpha mask
of an overlayed logo, the logo is removed where it is not
opaque.</li>
<li><b>Logo inpainting</b>: Opaque parts of the logo are
interpolated. A fast method is used which has been
published recently by
Folkmar Bornemann and Tom M&auml;rz
and which is roughly described
<a href="#MathInpaint">below</a>.</li>
</ul>

Finally, a function for calculating the
distance function of a mask is provided,
which can be used to expand or inflate masks as well as
to provide smooth blending masks.

    </p>
    <p>

This plugin is designed to work with Avisynth+ and AviSynth 2.6.
Supported color spaces are (generally) RGB24, RGB32, YUY2, YV12.

<code>InpaintLogo</code> restores masked parts of video frames
by interpolation with non-masked parts of the frame.
Each masked pixel will be inpainted by averaging surrounding
pixels. The weights of this averaging are determined by
calculating a special <i>structure tensor</i> that contains
information about the directions of isophotes near that pixel.

    </p>
    <p>
     <ul>
      <li>

<var>Clip</var> is the damaged source clip. All color spaces
are allowed. If no <var>Mask</var> is provided, the source
clip must be RGB32 and the alpha channel is used as mask
(see <var>Mask</var> for details).
Otherwise all color channels of <var>Clip</var> will be
inpainted.
The resulting clip will have the same properties as the source
clip.

      </li>
      <li>

<var>Mask</var> defines the parts of the video which will be
treated by the plugin.
This clip may either have a YUV colorspace (the Y channel is
used) or RGB32 (the alpha channel is used).
All pixels of the source clip where this mask has values
greater than 127 will be inpainted.
The mask clip must have the same (spatial) dimensions as
the source clip.
Moving logos are allowed: If the mask changes in time,
the inpainted region in the source clip will change
accordingly.
If the logo is fixed (hence all mask frames are equal),
the mask clip should be trimmed to one single frame
indicating a static logo to the function. Since each
movement of the inpainting region causes a lot new
calculations, inpainting static logos is much faster.

      </li>
      <li>

<var>Radius</var> describes the neighborhood of a damaged
pixel from where values are taken when the pixel is
inpainted. Bigger values prevent isophotes being
inpainted in the wrong direction, but also
create more blur.
(default: 5.0&nbsp;Px)

      </li>
      <li>

<var>Sharpness</var> describes how faithfull the algorithm
follows directional information contained in the structure
tensor. Higher values can prevent blurring caused by
high <var>Radius</var> values. (default: 30.0)

      </li>
      <li>

<var>PreBlur</var> is the standard deviation of the blur which
is applied to the image before the structure tensor is
computed.
Higher values help connecting isophotes which have been
cut by the inpainting region, but also increase
CPU usage. <code><var>PreBlur</var>=0.0</code> disables
pre-blurring. (default: 0.5 Px)

      </li>
      <li>

<var>PostBlur</var> is the standard deviation of the blur which
is applied to the structure tensors before they are used to
determine the inpainting direction.
Higher values help gathering enough directional information
when there are only few valid pixels available, but also
need lots of CPU cycles. (default: 4.0 Px)

      </li>
      <li>

<var>ChromaWeight</var> describes how chroma channels
are taken into account when the structure tensor
is build.
After tensors for each color channel are set up, tensors
are added, where luma is weighted with
<code>1.0-<var>ChromaWeight</var></code>,
and all chroma tensors together with <var>ChromaWeight</var>.
Tensors not needed are not computed.
This parameter is ignored for RGB color spaces: Each channel
is weighted equally then. (default: 0.0)

      </li>
      <li>

<var>PreBlurSize</var> and <var>PostBlurSize</var>
describe the sizes of the
blurring kernels used for pre blurring and post blurring,
respectively.
(default: <code>2&times;<var>PreBlur</var></code>
and <code>2&times;<var>PostBlur</var></code>, resp.)

      </li>
      <li>

When <var>ChromaTensor</var> is set to <code>true</code>,
all structure tensors will be computed <i>again</i>
before a chroma channel pixel is inpainted (after the
corresponding luma pixel has been inpainted).
Chroma values are always inpainted after a luma value
has been inpainted
in the same position.
This can be especially usefull when chroma channels have a
lower resultion than luma channels (e.g. YUY2, YV12), i.e.
the chroma pixel is not in exactly the same position
in which the just inpainted luma pixel is.
This argument is ignored for RGB color spaces.
(default: <code>false</code>)

      </li>
      <li>

<var>PixelAspect</var> is the ratio between
width and height of a pixel. E.g. for 16:9 DVD movies
with a resolution of 720x576, one would use
<code><var>PixelAspect</var>=(16.0/9.0)*(576.0/720.0)</code>&asymp;1.422.
This value
distorts the circle defined by <var>Radius</var> as well
as the blurring kernels and kernel extents and modifies the
inpainting order of pixels.
(default: 1.0)

      </li>
      <li>

If <var>Steps</var> is non-negative, only the first
<var>Steps</var> pixels (in the inpainting order which is
determined by the distance of the pixels to the border of the
inpainting region) are inpainted,
all remaining pixels will be untouched. This
is mainly usefull for visualizing how the function works and
for debugging purposes. If <var>Steps</var> is less then -1,
a copyright message will be displayed (along with an error
message). (default: -1)

      </li>
     </ul>

    </p>
    <p>
If the mask is provided as a separate clip (<var>Mask</var>
argument), <i>all</i> color channels available in the
source <var>Clip</var> will be inpainted, <i>including</i>
the alpha
channel, it the source is RGB32. In most cases this is
not desired since it needs additional CPU time, and information
from the alpha channel is also used for inpainting the
color channels
which might tamper the results. To avoid this, use
<code>ConvertToRGB24</code> first when working with RGB32
clips.

    </p>
    <p>

The following table shows which combinations of color spaces
are allowed and which color channels will be inpainted and
returned.

    </p>
    <p align=center>

<table>
 <thead>
  <tr>
   <th align=left><var>Mask</var></th>
   <th align=right width=1><var>Clip</var>:</th>
   <th>RGB24</th>
   <th>RGB32</th>
   <th>YUY2 / YV12</th>
  </tr>

 <tbody align=center>
  <tr>
   <th colspan=2>RGB32 / YUY2 / YV12</th>
   <td>R,G,B</td><td>R,G,B,A</td><td>Y,U,V</td>

   <td></td><td>R,G,B</td><td></td>
  </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>
   
    </p>
    <p>

YUV color spaces (YUY2, YV12) are usually better considering
speed and quality (the latter because RGB colors easily
become distorted when different channels are treated
differently). Yet, color spaces with subsampled chroma
channels (which applies to both, YUY2 and YV12) may expose
difficulties when the inpainting mask does not respect the
subsampling: If some of the chroma pixels are partly masked
(i.e. some of the corresponding luma pixels are masked for
inpainting, some are not), the respective chroma pixel
will be masked for inpainting, although it might be possible
there are not enough non-masked or yet inpainted chroma pixels
around when it's its turn to be inpainted.
In such chase, the chroma pixel will simply left untouched
which will generate a reasonable result in most cases.
However, to avoid such problems make sure each partly masked
chroma pixel has a neighboring non-masked chroma pixel
(e.g. by forcing your mask on the chroma grid, or by
inflating and then deflating your mask by at least
three pixels).

    </p>
    <p>

There is no explicit mechanism that deals with parts of the
picture which are destroied but which should not or cannot be
recovered (like black bars on the top and the bottom of the
movie). If you cannot <code>Crop</code> away these parts,
mask them for inpaint. Otherwise the function would
consider them as valid data and use them for inpainting
(black bars usually create a big spurious edge!).

    </p>
    <p>

It is in general a hard (or even impossible) task to find
parameters for good inpainting a fixed mask for a
long movie. The best choice of parameters depends on several
factors, like
<ul>
<li>the shape of the mask</li>
<li>the amount of &ldquo;good&rdquo; pixels available near the mask border</li>
<li>the complexity of the underlying pictures</li>
<li>...</li>
<li>your personal flavor</li>
</ul>
In most cases it is a good idea to pick some frames of the movie,
stack them together with <code>Stack*al</code> and watch
the changes with <code>ScriptClip</code>
as you change the parameters.

    </p>
    <p>

<b>Beware</b>: This algorithm has originally been
developed for inpainting <i>pictures</i>, not movies.
No temporal information is used for inpainting.
You might observe strong discontinuities in time
(jumping of shapes created by the algorithm).
See <a href="#MathInpaint">below</a> for some details
on how the algorithm works.


    </p>
   <h3>Deblend Function</h3>
    <p>
     <code>DeblendLogo</code>(<var>clip Clip,
                                   clip Logo,
                                   clip &quot;Alpha&quot;</var>)
    </p>
    <p>

<code>DeblendLogo</code> is roughly the inverse function
of <code>Layer</code>: If a clip (the <i>logo</i>) is blended
onto another clip (by using a given alpha mask),
<code>DeblendLogo</code> tries to undo this and to
restore the original clip.

    </p>
    <p>
     <ul>
      <li>
      
<var>Clip</var> is the source clip with the logo which you
want to deblend.
It can have any color space. The resulting clip will have the
same properties.

      </li>
      <li>

<var>Logo</var> contains the logo you want to remove from
the source clip.
The logo may be moving, but a static logo (<var>Logo</var>
<i>and</i> <var>Mask</var> having only one frame)
results in faster processing since
some values can be pre-computed.
If <var>Mask</var> is not provided, <var>Logo</var> must
be RGB32, <var>Clip</var> RGB24, and the alpha channel is
used as mask. Otherwise, <var>Logo</var> must have the same
color space as <var>Clip</var>.

      </li>
      <li>

<var>Mask</var> contains the transparency mask of the logo you
want to remove.
This clip may either have a YUV colorspace (the Y channel is
used) or RGB32 (the alpha channel is used).
Pixel values of 0 mean <i>full transparency</i> (the source
clip is returned unchanged here), values of 255 means
<i>full opacity</i> (the logo cannot be deblended in these
regions, the resulting pixels will have undefined values).
<i>The interval [0,255] also applies to YUV masks</i>, so 
do not forget to add
<code>Matrix="PC.601"</code>
to the converting function when converting RGB masks to YUV.

      </li>
     </ul>
    </p>
    <p>

The following table shows which combinations of color spaces
are allowed and which color channels will be deblended and
returned.

   <h3>Analyze Function</h3>
    <p>
     <code>AnalyzeLogo</code>(<var>clip Clip,
                                   clip &quot;Mask&quot;,
                                   bool &quot;ComputeAlpha&quot;,
                                   float &quot;DeviationWeight&quot;,
                                   float &quot;SubsamplingWeight&quot;</var>)
    </p>
    <p>

<code>AnalyzeLogo</code> tries to determine the color image and
the alpha mask of a static logo which is part of a given
source clip. The result of this function can be used to remove
transparent parts of the logo with <code>DeblendLogo</code>
and opaque parts with <code>InpaintLogo</code>.

    </p>
    <p>
     <ul>
      <li>

<var>Clip</var> is the source clip containing the logo to be
analyzed. This clip may have any color space.
If <var>Mask</var> is not provided, <var>Clip</var> must
be RGB32 and the alpha channel is
used as mask.
In general the resulting clip will have the same properties
of the source clip except being twice as high: The upper part
contains the color image of the logo, the lower part the
alpha mask. If no separate mask is provided (the mask being
the alpha channel of the source clip), the resulting clip
will also be a RGB32 clip with the same hight and the
logo alpha mask being placed in the alpha channel.

      </li>
      <li>

<var>Mask</var> defines the parts of the video where the logo
is suspected to be. This clip may either have a
YUV colorspace (the Y channel of the first frame is used)
or RGB32 (the alpha channel of the first frame is used).
All pixels of the source clip where this mask has values
greater than 127 will be treated as
&ldquo;possibly damaged by the logo&rdquo;,
all other pixels are used
as reference (they are <i>not</i> ignored).
If <var>ComputeAlpha</var> is set to <code>false</code>,
<var>Mask</var> is expected to contain the alpha mask of the
logo
(obeying the same conventions as described above for
<code>DeblendLogo</code>),
and the function will only determine the color part.

      </li>
      <li>

When <var>ComputeAlpha</var> is set to <code>true</code>,
the analyzer tries to determine both the alpha mask and the
color part of the logo, based on where the <var>Mask</var>
clip has values greater than 127.
If it is set to <code>false</code>, <var>Mask</var> must
already contain the alpha mask of the logo, and only the
color part is computed. In both cases, the mask will be
returned.
(default: <code>true</code>)

      </li>
      <li>

<var>DeviationWeight</var> and <var>SubsamplingWeight</var>
define the way the alpha mask of the logo is estimated.
Since video clips contain multiple color channels, the alpha
mask is first computed for each channel separately,
the final mask then is a weighted mean of those.
The weights are a product of the alpha values (each alpha
value is weighted with itself) and of the degree of
subsampling (0.5 for YUY2, 0.25 for YV12) of each channel.
These arguments define the exponents of those factors &mdash;
0.0 means the weight is not used at all.
A negative value for one of these arguments will show a
copyright message (along with an error message).
(default: 0.5 for both)

      </li>
     </ul>
    </p>
    <p>

If the mask is provided as separate clip (<var>Mask</var>
argument), <i>all</i> color channels available in the
source clip will be analyzed, <i>including</i> the alpha
channel of an RGB32 clip. In most cases this is
not desired since it needs additional CPU time, and information
from the alpha channel is also used for estimating the
overall alpha values.
To avoid this, use
<code>ConvertToRGB24</code> first when working with RGB32
clips.

    </p>
    <p>

The following table shows which combinations of color spaces
are allowed and which color spaces will be analyzed. Note that
the clip returned will be twice as high as the source clip if
a <var>Mask</var> is provided.

    </p>

    </p>
    <p>

As with <code>InpaintLogo</code>, there is a problem with
subsampled chroma channels. The alpha mask values of two (luma)
pixels with highly different alpha values which share a common
chroma pixel cannot be reliably estimated from thier chroma
channel values. This effect usually produces some dirt in the
estimated alpha mask and subsequently in the color mask.
Such effects, when observed, can be avoided (besides by
converting to RGB24) by increasing the
<var>SubsamplingWeight</var>.

    </p>
    <p>

There is no explicit mechanism that deals with parts of the
picture which are destroied or otherwise not part of the clip
(like black bars on the top and the bottom of the
movie). If you cannot <code>Crop</code> away these parts,
mask them for analyzing. Otherwise the function would
consider them as valid data and use them for reference when
estimating the logo's color and alpha mask.
   
    </p>
   <h3>DistanceFunction</h3>
    <p>
     <code>DistanceFunction</code>(<var>clip Clip,
                                        float &quot;Scale&quot;,
                                        float &quot;PixelAspect&quot;</var>)
    </p>
    <p>

<code>DistanceFunction</code> computes the distance function
around or inside a given set of pixels. E.g. it can create
a frame, where each pixels value is the distance of the
respective pixel
to a given set of pixels. This is typically used to inflate or
deflate masks, or to create masks with smooth borders out
of binary masks.

     <ul>
      <li>

<var>Clip</var> is the source clip. This clip must either be
a YUV clip, or RGB32. For YUV clips, only the Y channel will
be altered, for RGB32 clips the alpha channel will be changed.

      </li>
      <li>

<var>Scale</var> scales the gray values around the pixel set
under consideration.
For positive <var>Scale</var>s the significant area for
distance calculation are all pixels
with values greater than 127. This area will be turned white by
this function.
Each pixel outside this area
with distance <span id=math>d</span> to the area will be
assigned the value <span id=math>255-d&times;<var>Scale</var></span>
(or 0, if it would be negative).
If <var>Scale</var> is negative, the color channel will be inverted
before and after computation.
If <var>Scale</var> is zero, the image is simply made binary
(roughly the same as <code>Levels(127,1,128,0,255)</code>).
(default: 1.0)

      </li>
      <li>

<var>PixelAspect</var> is the ratio between
width and height of a pixel. E.g. for 16:9 DVD movies
with a resolution of 720x576, one would use
<code><var>PixelAspect</var>=(16.0/9.0)*(576.0/720.0)</code>&asymp;1.422.
The result of this function is distorted according
to this value.
A negative value will show a

   <h3>Sample Script</h3>
    <p>

This script opens a video file and
removes a small logo in the upper left edge.
We assume the movie being a 16:9 DVD clip
with a resoultion of 720&times;576 pixel.
The logo is roughly a square with its
upper left corner in (20,20) and size (10,10).

    </p>
    <p>

This script opens the movie and isolates the logo including
some surrounding area. This surrounding area is needed
by <code>AnalyzeLogo</code> and <code>InpaintLogo</code>
as reference data.
Since the pixel aspect ratio is higher than 1.0, we give the
algorithms some more pixels from below the logo.

<pre>
AVISource("Movie.avi")
FullClip = ConvertToRGB32
ConvertToRGB24
Crop(0,0,50,70)</pre>

    </p>
    <p>

These lines creates a mask which broadly surrounds the logo.
For complicated logos (circles...) you would draw this by hand
and import it with <code>ImageSource</code>.

<pre>
MyMask = ConvertToRGB32.BlankClip(Length=1)
MyMask = MyMask.Layer(MyMask.BlankClip(Width=14,Height=14,Color=Color_White).ResetMask,x=18,y=18)
MyMask = MyMask.Mask(MyMask)</pre>

    </p>
    <p>

This script analyzes the logo and returns
an approximation of the logo color map and its
alpha mask.
Since color map and alpha mask are returned stacked on
each other, they need to be merged into one RGB32 clip.

<pre>
Logo = last.AnalyzeLogo(MyMask).Trim(0,-1).ConvertToRGB32
Logo = Logo.Crop(0,0,0,Logo.Height/2).Mask(Logo.Crop(0,Logo.Height/2,0,0))</pre>

    </p>
    <p>

These lines do the dirty work: The logo is deblended
by using the color and alpha mask returned by
<code>AnalyzeLogo</code>.
Then all parts with high alpha value (bigger than 235)
are inpainted with <code>InpaintLogo</code>.
Finally to avoid spurious edges where we isolated
the logo region in the beginning, we smoothly <code>Layer</code>
our result into the original clip.
The mask needed for this is generated with
<code>DistanceFunction</code>.

<pre>
last.DeblendLogo(Logo.ConvertToRGB24,Logo)
last.InpaintLogo(Logo.Mask(Logo.ShowAlpha.Levels(235,1,236,0,255)),4.0,50.0,4.0,6.0,PixelAspect=16.0*576.0/9.0/720.0)
FullClip.Layer(last.ConvertToRGB32.Mask(MyMask.DistanceFunction(256.0/8.0)))</pre>

This part tries to describe the algorithms used in this plugin
and the mathematics that led to these algorithms.

   <h3 id="MathInpaint">Image Inpainting</h3>
    <p>

This section coarsely summarizes the article <a href="#Ref">[BM]</a>.

    </p>
    <p>

A generic approach to filling the
&ldquo;black holes&rdquo; of a pixel
image is filling pixels at the border
of the inpaining domain (the area which needs to be inpainted)
with weighted means of valid (originally or already inpainted)
pixel values around the respective pixel.
With the image being described by a function
<span id=math>u</span>,
the inpainted pixel at position <span id=math>x<sub>0</sub></span>
would have the value (see <a href="#Ref">[BM,(2)]</a>)
<div id=math>u(x<sub>0</sub>) = <b>( </b>&sum;<sub>y</sub> w(x<sub>0</sub>,y)u(y)<b> ) / ( </b>&sum;<sub>y</sub> w(x<sub>0</sub>,y)<b> )</b> .</div>
Here <span id=math>y</span> runs through all pixels
inside a ball of a user defined radius
<span id=math>&epsilon;</span>
around <span id=math>x<sub>0</sub></span> with valid values.
This idea has been proposed in <a href="#Ref">[Te]</a>.
The order of inpainting is given by the distance of the
pixels to the domain boundary &mdash; the pixels are inpainted
form the boundary inwards.
Telea <a href="#Ref">[Te]</a> proposes a weight function <span id=math>w</span>
which depends only on the shape of the inpainting domain,
and which will not be further studied here.

    </p>
    <p>

In <a href="#Ref">[BM,(11)]</a> an alternative weight function is proposed which
depends on information extracted from valid image data:
<div id=math>w(x,y) &cong; &mu;(x) <b>exp(</b>- &mu;(x)<sup>2</sup> |c(x)<sup>&perp;</sup>&middot;(x-y)|<sup>2</sup> <b>/</b> (2 &epsilon;<sup>2</sup>) <b>) /</b> |x-y| </div>
Here <span id=math>c(x)</span> is a unit vector describing
the desired inpainting direction (the direction in which
pixel values shall be transported inside the inpainting
domain).
<span id=math>&mu;(x)</span> controls how reliable that
direction is: Low values will create a lot of blur
while for high values the weighted mean sticks to the
direction given by <span id=math>c</span>.
These values need to be extracted from already known pixel
values.

    </p>
    <p>

A natural idea for <span id=math>c(x)</span> are directions
of isophotes around <span id=math>x</span>:
<span id=math>c(x) = (&nabla;u (x))<sup>&perp;</sup></span>.
Regrettably this approach is very sensitive to noise.
Better results can be achiven by using
Weickert's structure tensor <a href="#Ref">[We]</a>.
Here, blurring by convoluting with a Gaussian
with standard deviation <span id=math>&sigma;</span>
is denoted by
adding <span id=math>&sigma;</span> as an index to the
blurred function,
e.g. <span id=math>u<sub>&sigma;</sub></span>.
To neutralize noise, the image is blurred first with
<span id=math>&sigma;</span>.
Then a tensor is set up
out of the gradient function
<span id=math>&nabla;u<sub>&sigma;</sub></span>:
<div id=math>&nabla;u<sub>&sigma;</sub>(x) &otimes; &nabla;u<sub>&sigma;</sub>(x)</div>
This (<span id=math>x</span>-dependent) tensor is then again
blurred with standard deviation <span id=math>&rho;</span>.
The eigenvector to the minimal eigenvalue of this
function evaluated in <span id=math>x<sub>0</sub></span>
(the <i>coherence direction</i>)
is a good smoothing of the isophote direction
<span id=math>(&nabla;u (x<sub>0</sub>))<sup>&perp;</sup></span>,
the difference between the eigenvalues
is a measure of reliability
of the coherence direction.

    </p>
    <p>

Unfortunately, in most cases approximately
half of the pixels around 
<span id=math>x<sub>0</sub></span>
are unknown and these blurrs cannot be computed.
To avoid this problem, both blurring steps
are modified according to <a href="#Ref">[BM,(21)]</a>.
Let <span id=math>&chi;</span> be the function
which is <span id=math>1</span> on valid pixels
and <span id=math>0</span> on pixels still to be
inpainted.
The new final (blurred) structure tensor reads:
<div id=math>J<sub>&sigma;,&rho;</sub>(x) = <b>(</b> &chi; &nabla;v<sub>&sigma;</sub> &otimes; &nabla;v<sub>&sigma;</sub> <b>)</b><sub>&rho;</sub>(x) <b>/</b> &chi;<sub>&rho;</sub>(x)</div>
with <span id=math>v<sub>&sigma;</sub>(x) = <b>(</b>&chi;u<b>)</b><sub>&sigma;</sub>(x) / &chi;<sub>&sigma;</sub>(x)</span>.
With this tensor the inpainting direction
<span id=math>c(x)</span> is the (normed)
eigenvector to the minimal eigenvalue of
<span id=math>J<sub>&sigma;,&rho;</sub></span>
(see <a href="#Ref">[BM,(22)]</a>).
The reliability value <span id=math>&mu;(x)</span>
is defined by the difference of the eigenvalues
<span id=math>&lambda;<sub>1</sub></span> and
<span id=math>&lambda;<sub>2</sub></span>
through (see <a href="#Ref">[BM,(20)]</a>)
<div id=math>&mu; = 1+&kappa;<b>exp(</b>-(&lambda;<sub>2</sub>-&lambda;<sub>1</sub>)<sup>-2</sup><b>)</b> .</div>
<span id=math>&kappa;&gt;0</span> is a user-defined
sharpness parameter.

    </p>
    <p>

The gradients <span id=math>&nabla;v<sub>&sigma;</sub></span>
are computed with forward differences (high oscillacions are
not visible for symmetric differences), the unavoidable
0.5 pixel shift of the image is compensated by shifted
blurring kernels when post blurring (with standard
deviation <span id=math>&rho;</span>) is applied.

For color images (images with multiple color channels),
following the ideas of <a href="#Ref">[BM,&sect;6]</a>,
a common structure tensor is used, which is a
weighted mean of the tensors of each channel.

To speed up computation, the (blurred) nominator and
the denominator
of <span id=math>v<sub>&sigma;</sub></span> are precomputed
and updated in each iteration step (see <a href="#Ref">[BM,&sect;6]</a>).
A further speed increase is achieved by using the
Fast Marching Method for calculating the inpainting order
(see <a href="#MathFastMarching">below</a>).
For fixed inpainting domains, this can be done in advance
and can be reused on each frame.

    </p>
   <h3>Deblending</h3>
    <p>

Deblending is a local process
(pixels do not affect their neighbors):
It simply inverts the process of blending two images.

Let <span id=math>x</span> be a unblended pixel value,
<span id=math>c</span> the color value of the corresponding
logo pixel and <span id=math>&alpha;</span> the corresponding
alpha mask value, all in the interval [0,255].
Then the blended pixel value <span id=math>y</span> is:
<div id=math>y = <b>(</b> &alpha;c+(255-&alpha;)x <b>) / </b>255</div>
(Please note that this is <i>not</i> the formula used by
<code>Layer</code>. Layer uses
<span id=math>x+(c-x)&times;(256&alpha;)/256/256</span>
in AviSynth 2.56 and
<span id=math>x+(c-x)&times;(257&alpha;+1)/256/256</span>
in AviSynth 2.57 (see the Layer help page and
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1637764&group_id=57023&atid=482673">Bug 1637764</a>
for details).)

    </p>
    <p>
    
This process can easily be undone:
<div id=math>x = <b>(</b> 255y-&alpha;c <b>) / (</b> 255-&alpha; <b>)</b></div>
This obviously fails for <span id=math>&alpha;=255</span>
since opaque areas of the logo cannot be deblended.
Also bad results can be expected for
<span id=math>&alpha;&asymp;255</span>.
For fixed logos, the expressions
<span id=math>&alpha;c</span> and
<span id=math>255-&alpha;</span>
can be computed in advance to save some CPU time.

    </p>
   <h3>Analyzing</h3>
    <p>

The ideas presented in this section are mostly inspired
by Karel Suhajda's DeLogo plugin <a href="#Ref">[Ka]</a>
where a similar method is implemented.

    </p>
    <p>

The user provides a movie clip with a fixed alpha-bleded
logo which the <code>Analyze</code> algorithm tries to find.
To this end, it assumes all pixel (of the unblended clip) have
equal value disribution with some average value and some
standard deviation.
This assumption is obviously pretty bad for
clips with multiple color spaces, since e.g.
a grayscale movie will have
a high standard deviation in the Y channel, but
none in both chroma channels. Hence the following
ideas refer to only one channel at a time.
The results for each channel will be merged later,
when necessary.

    </p>
    <p>

Since the user provides the function with a mask decomposing
the image domain into an area where the logo might be
(the <i>logo domain</i>)
and an area where the logo is definitely not, the latter
area is a good data pool to compute
the average pixel value
<span id=math>x<sub>0</sub></span>
and the standard deviation
<span id=math>&sigma;<sub>0</sub></span>
of those values.

Inside the logo domain, the average value
<span id=math>x</span>
and standard deviation
<span id=math>&sigma;</span>
<i>of each pixel</i> can also be computed.
Under the assumption that all pixels inside the logo domain
also have been
<span id=math>(x<sub>0</sub>,&sigma;<sub>0</sub>)</span>-distributed
before the logo was added, the alpha mask value
<span id=math>&alpha;</span> of a logo pixel can
be estimated by
<div id=math>&alpha; = 255&sigma;/&sigma;<sub>0</sub> .</div>
With the average pixel values, the color value
<span id=math>c</span>
of the logo can be estimated in a similar way:
<div id=math>c = <b>(</b> 255x-(255-&alpha;)x<sub>0</sub> <b>) / </b>&alpha;</div>
Again, this failes for <span id=math>&alpha;&asymp;0</span>,
which is not a problem since in this case there is nothing
to deblend.

    </p>
    <p>

This method generates an alpha mask for each channel.
To receive one alpha mask, these channel masks need to be
merged in some clever way.
As described above, not every channel can be used to generate
&ldquo;good&rdquo; alpha estimates: Some channels are
simply not used (grayscale movies), other channels are
artificially blurred (subsampled color channels).
To circumvent problems coming from these effects,
the final alpha estimate is a weighted mean of
the alpha proposals from each channel, where the
weight is a power of the alpha estimate itself
multiplied with a power of the subsampling factor
(e.g. 0.25 for YV12). The exponents are exposed to the user.

    </p>
    <p>

The average values are simply computed by summing up all
pixel values
<span id=math>(x<sub>k</sub>)<sub>1&le;k&le;n</sub></span>
and dividing by the number
<span id=math>n</span> of pixels.
The standard deviation is the square root of the variance
which is computed with the notorious formula
<div id=math>  <b>(</b> &sum;x<sub>k</sub><sup>2</sup> - (&sum;x<sub>k</sub>)<sup>2</sup>/n <b>) / (</b>n-1<b>)</b> .</div>
The summation over all video frames is the most time consuming
part. The sums are taken for each pixel separately and
stored in 32-bit variables. To prevent overflow of the
sum of squares, <i>all</i> pixel values are reduced by 128
prior to computation. If the limit of the summation variables
is reached, the summation stops
and the number of frames processed is reported to the user.
All subsequent summations are performed in single precision
arithmetics. The summation over all non-masked pixels is
carried out with Kahan's summation formula.

    </p>
   <h3 id="MathFastMarching">Fast Marching</h3>
    <p>

The Fast Marching Method is an algorithm used to compute the
signed distance function of a set, as it is done by
<code>DistanceFunction</code>. Since this method traverses all
pixels in the order of their distance to the given set
(beginning at the boundary), this method is also helpful for
determining the pixel order in <code>InpaintLogo</code>.

The basic idea is to create a narrow band around the set
boundary
and moving this zone away from the initial set. Pixels are
computed inside this zone and frozen when left behine the zone.

    </p>
    <p>

All pixels will have one of three states, which are called,
in accordance to <a ref="#Ref">[Se,&sect;3.1]</a>:
<ul>
<li><b>A</b>live: All pixels with fixed value</li>
<li><b>C</b>lose: The pixels in the narrow band</li>
<li><b>F</b>ar: All pixels outside the band with still undetermined value</li>
</ul>
As initialization, all points with fixed values
(the set of pixels on which the distance map is based upon)
are flagged <b>A</b>.
All non-<b>A</b> pixels touching (in the 5-pixel-sense)
<b>A</b>-points are marked as <b>C</b>. All other pixels are
marked as <b>F</b>.

    </p>
    <p>

Each <b>C</b>-pixel <span id=math>x</span>
is assigned a value based on
<a href="#Ref">[Se,(14)]</a>:
<div id=math>  <b>max{</b> &part;<sub>1</sub><sup>-</sup><i>u</i> , -&part;<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup><i>u</i> , 0<b>}</b><sup>2</sup> + <b>max{</b> &part;<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup><i>u</i> , -&part;<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup><i>u</i> , 0<b>}</b><sup>2</sup> = 1  </div>
Here
<span id=math>&part;<sub>1</sub><sup>&plusmn;</sup> = &plusmn;<b>(</b>u(x&plusmn;1<sub>1</sub>)-u(x)<b>)/</b>h<sub>1</sub></span>
and
<span id=math>&part;<sub>2</sub><sup>&plusmn;</sup> = &plusmn;<b>(</b>u(x&plusmn;1<sub>2</sub>)-u(x)<b>)/</b>h<sub>2</sub></span>
denote foreward (+) and backward (-) difference quotions in
<span id=math>x<sub>1</sub></span>- and
<span id=math>x<sub>2</sub></span>-directions,
<span id=math>x&plusmn;1<sub>1</sub></span>
are the pixels east (+) and west (-) of <span id=math>x</span>,
<span id=math>x&plusmn;1<sub>2</sub></span>
are those south (+) and north (-) of <span id=math>x</span>,
and <span id=math>h<sub>1</sub></span>
and <span id=math>h<sub>2</sub></span>
are the width and height of a pixel, respectively.
When evaluating this formula for a <b>C</b>-pixel
<span id=math>x</span>, all non-<b>A</b>-pixels around
<span id=math>x</span> are replace by
<span id=math>&infin;</span>, hence they are not considered
inside the maxima. The result still is well-defined as each
<b>C</b>-pixel has at least one <b>A</b>-neighbor.


    </p>
    <p>

In each iteration step, the <b>C</b>-pixel with the smallest
value is marked as <b>A</b>live (which means it is fixed).
All values around this pixel are marked as <b>C</b>lose
(if not done earlier) and their values are updated as
described above.
By following this procedure, the pixels around the initial
set are marked as <b>A</b>live in the order of their distance
to the set, which provides the order needed for the inpainting
algorithm.
To increase computational speed, all <b>C</b>-pixels
are stored in a heap which makes sorting their values and
finding the smallest element easy
(see <a href="#Ref">[Se,&sect;3.2]</a> for details).
